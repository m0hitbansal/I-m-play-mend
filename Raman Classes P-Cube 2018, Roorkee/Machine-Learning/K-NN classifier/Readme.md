# KNN-classifier
### Introduction
This is an elementary assignment of implementing knn-classifier from scratch using first principles. Multiple experiments have been carried out by varying the **K** and _size of testing and training dataset_

### How to run
* To run just the knn implementation, compile and run the _cplusplus_ program
* To plot the graph
  * Separate the **change_k_result.txt** file in new files named as _file1.csv_,_file2.csv_ etc..
  * Run the shell script
 
**knn_classifier**: Open the program in an editor and edit the parameters under the heading _**HUMAN PARAMETERS**_ and set parameters accordingly.
* This program, breaks the dataset into testing and training dataset
* Sets the class label 
* Reads the dataset and maintains datastructure
* Implements KNN classifier
* Saves results in files accordingly

**plot_graph**: This program is used to plot the graph

### Results

* For training set = 40 per class, graph between change in K and accuracy is

* For training set = 32 per class, graph between change in K and accuracy is
